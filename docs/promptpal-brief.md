# **Product Brief**

## **1\. Problem Statement**

AI users struggle to store, organize, and reuse prompts efficiently. Current methods such as documents, notes, and spreadsheets are slow, manual, and error-prone, especially when experimenting with multiple models. Users need a lightweight but reliable system to structure prompts, manage modular components, and quickly run or share prompts without constant copy-pasting.

As AI adoption spreads, mid-level and casual users also face the same friction. They may not be "power users," but they still need simple, time-saving ways to keep prompts handy and reusable.

### **Solution Architecture**

The solution consists of two integrated components:

* **Web Application:** Central hub for creating, organizing, editing, and managing prompt libraries with full CRUD functionality.  
* **Chrome Extension:** Lightweight execution layer that syncs with the web app, enabling quick access and execution of prompts directly in the browser while using AI tools.

## **2\. Target Users**

* **Primary:** Daily AI power users such as researchers, creators, consultants, and professionals who rely on prompts in their workflows.  
* **Secondary:** Emerging AI practitioners (educators, team leads, product managers) who want to standardize or share prompts within teams.  
* **Mid-Level & Casual Users:** Professionals experimenting with AI in their work, seeking an easy way to save, organize, and reuse prompts without needing advanced frameworks.  
* **Advanced:** Users working with modular frameworks (context, persona, goals, examples, etc.) who need to run and test prompts across multiple LLMs.

## **3\. Goals**

* **Web App:** Provide a structured, searchable library for storing, editing, and organizing prompts with full management capabilities.  
* **Chrome Extension:** Enable quick access to prompt library and direct execution with LLMs or fast copy/paste into other tools.  
* Support modular prompt design with multiple options per section.  
* Handle variables intelligently (none, single with selection, or multiple with inline input).  
* Ensure seamless sync between web app and extension for consistent prompt access.  
* Support collaboration and sharing for both individuals and teams.  
* Provide reliable scalability features such as export/import, error handling, and subscription/licensing for long-term use.  
* Lower the barrier for casual users through starter libraries, pre-built templates, and simple onboarding.

## **4\. Differentiators**

* **Two-Component Architecture** – Web app for comprehensive management, extension for execution convenience.  
* **Purpose-Built Prompt Handling** – Inline variable input, multi-option sections, and execution shortcuts tailored to prompts.  
* **Direct Model Execution** – Instantly run prompts with different LLMs from the extension, something generic tools can't provide.  
* **Structured Modularity** – Prompts broken into reusable components (persona, style, context, examples) instead of unstructured text blobs.  
* **Seamless Sync** – Changes in web app instantly available in extension for uninterrupted workflow.  
* **Scalability** – Usable even with large prompt libraries, thanks to search, filters, and performance safeguards.  
* **Team-Ready Roadmap** – Future support for collaboration, subaccounts, analytics, and secure API key management.

## **5\. Success Metrics**

* **Adoption:** Number of prompts stored and executed per user after 30 days.  
* **Efficiency:** Reduction in copy/paste operations compared to baseline tools.  
* **Scalability:** Ability to handle large prompt libraries (\>500 prompts) without performance issues.  
* **Collaboration:** % of users inviting teammates or sharing prompts internally.  
* **Satisfaction:** User-reported time saved and satisfaction scores (\>80% positive).

## **6\. MVP Scope**

### **Web Application**

* Structured prompt library (create, edit, organize, delete).  
* Full CRUD operations for prompts and collections.  
* Search and filtering functionality.  
* Modular prompt builder (sections, multiple options).  
* Variable configuration (none, single, or multiple).  
* Import/export of libraries.  
* User account and authentication.  
* Sync API for extension communication.

### **Chrome Extension**

* Read-only access to synced prompt library.  
* Quick search and browse prompts.  
* Select options when a prompt module has several alternatives.  
* Execution (direct run with LLMs or copy/paste).  
* Variable input handling at execution time.  
* Basic authentication and sync with web app.

### **Shared**

* Basic subscription/licensing model.  
* Core error handling and feedback (toasts, confirmations).

## **7\. Future Features (Not in MVP)**

* **Cloud Sync** – Seamless access to prompts across devices.  
* **Advanced Multi-Variable Templates** – Rich UI with pre-fills, defaults, and validation.  
* **Collaboration & Team Sharing** – Shared libraries, real-time editing, role permissions.  
* **Usage History & Analytics** – Track frequency, performance, and outcomes of prompts.  
* **Subaccounts** – Parent account with permissions, locked modules, and managed API keys.  
* **Advanced Options / Admin Page** – Subscription management, account controls, and team settings.  
* **Secure API Key Management** – OS-level storage and credential isolation.

## **8\. Out of Scope (MVP)**

* **Community Features** – Shared prompt libraries, public template marketplaces.  
* **UI Customization** – Custom themes, skins, or heavy visual personalization.

## **9\. Risks & Assumptions**

### **Risks**

* **Adoption Ceiling:** Tool may be too niche if limited to "power users" without appeal to mid-level or casual users.  
* **Differentiation Risk:** Users may stick with Notion, Airtable, or other DIY setups if value isn't clear.  
* **Integration Complexity:** Supporting multiple LLM APIs could balloon scope and maintenance costs.  
* **Scalability Gaps:** Without search/filter or performance safeguards, large prompt libraries could become unmanageable.  
* **Team Features Delay:** If collaboration is pushed too far down the roadmap, competitors may capture team use cases.  
* **Revenue Dependence:** Subscription/licensing may alienate early adopters if pricing doesn't match perceived value.

### **Assumptions**

* AI usage will keep growing across industries and daily workflows.  
* Prompt storage and reuse is a persistent problem not solved by existing generic tools.  
* Early adopters are willing to pay for efficiency and structure.  
* Individual adoption will precede team adoption (bottom-up growth).  
* Users will tolerate a lightweight MVP with limited polish if core functionality works well.
