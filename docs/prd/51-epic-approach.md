# 5.1 Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic

**Rationale**: PromptPal features are tightly interconnected - prompt creation requires modules, modules require variables, execution requires API keys. Breaking into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries and integration challenges. A single epic with carefully sequenced stories allows incremental delivery while maintaining system coherence.

**Story Sequencing Strategy**:
1. **Foundation first**: Database schema, core models, basic CRUD
2. **UI building blocks**: Reusable components, library view
3. **Advanced features**: Module system, variables, preview
4. **Integration**: API keys, LLM provider integration
5. **Polish**: Search, import/export, performance optimization

Each story delivers standalone value while building toward complete system.
