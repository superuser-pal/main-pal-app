# 6.11 Story 1.11: Prompt Execution with LLM Providers

**As a** user,
**I want** to execute prompts with my configured LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic),
**so that** I can test prompts and get AI responses directly in the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Prompt executor view displays module option selectors and variable input form
2. Users select options for each module (dropdowns or radio buttons)
3. Users fill in required variables with type-specific inputs (text, number, date picker, etc.)
4. Users select provider and model from configured API keys
5. Users click "Execute" button to send assembled prompt to LLM
6. Response displays in output pane with copy button and metadata (tokens, latency, cost estimate)

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: LLM API calls are rate limited per subscription tier (Free: 10/day, Pro: 100/day, Enterprise: 1000/day)
- **IV2**: API errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **IV3**: Execution history is logged for usage tracking

## Technical Notes

- Use API route (`POST /api/prompts/execute`) to proxy LLM requests (keep keys server-side)
- Implement timeout handling (30s default)
- Support streaming responses for real-time output (optional enhancement)
