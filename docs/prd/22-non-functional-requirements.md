# 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

## NFR1: Security
System shall encrypt API keys using AES-256, hash passwords using bcrypt, implement secure session management with JWT tokens, and protect against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).

## NFR2: Performance
System shall maintain sub-second response times for 95% of operations, support 100+ concurrent users per deployment, and implement progressive loading for large libraries (pagination at 50 items).

## NFR3: Scalability
Database schema shall support efficient querying at scale with appropriate indexes, foreign key constraints, and normalized structure for prompts, modules, variables, and folders.

## NFR4: Data Integrity
System shall implement transactional operations for prompt modifications, automatic save with optimistic UI updates, and conflict resolution for concurrent edits.

## NFR5: Error Handling
System shall provide user-friendly error messages, inline field validation, retry mechanisms for network failures, and graceful degradation during service outages.

## NFR6: Monitoring
System shall log critical operations, track API usage per user, monitor webhook delivery success rates, and alert on threshold breaches.

## NFR7: Testing Coverage
System shall maintain E2E test coverage for critical user flows (auth, prompt CRUD, module management, variable substitution) using Playwright infrastructure.

## NFR8: Documentation
Code shall follow existing TypeScript conventions, include JSDoc comments for public APIs, and maintain architecture documentation as system evolves.
