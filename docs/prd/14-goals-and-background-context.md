# 1.4 Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Build a production-ready prompt management platform that empowers AI power users to create, organize, and execute complex prompts
- Provide modular prompt architecture allowing users to compose reusable prompt components
- Enable variable-driven prompt templates with validation and type safety
- Support multi-provider LLM execution (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with API key management
- Deliver seamless browser extension integration for in-context prompt execution
- Establish foundation for team collaboration and prompt sharing (Phase 2)
- Maintain performance with large prompt libraries (1,000+ prompts per user)

## Background Context

The proliferation of AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) has created demand for sophisticated prompt management tools. Power users struggle with:
- **Prompt sprawl**: Dozens/hundreds of prompts scattered across notes, files, extensions
- **Lack of reusability**: Can't easily compose prompts from reusable modules
- **No variable support**: Manual find-replace for variations
- **Poor organization**: No hierarchical structure or search
- **Vendor lock-in**: Prompts tied to specific platforms

PromptPal solves this by providing a **centralized, modular prompt management system** that works across providers. The existing SaaS accelerator provides ideal foundation:
- ✅ User authentication and session management (Supabase)
- ✅ Subscription tiers for usage limits (Stripe)
- ✅ Database infrastructure (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
- ✅ API infrastructure for extension sync
- ✅ Secure secrets management for API keys
