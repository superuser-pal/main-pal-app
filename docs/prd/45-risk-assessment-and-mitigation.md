# 4.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

## Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**: Large prompt libraries may cause slow queries
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, add indexes on `user_id` + `created_at`, use database query analysis

2. **Variable Substitution Complexity**: Regex-based variable replacement may have edge cases
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive unit tests, escape special characters, validation before save

3. **LLM API Rate Limits**: Provider rate limits may block user executions
   - **Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff, queue system, surface errors clearly to users

## Integration Risks
1. **Auth Flow Disruption**: New protected routes may conflict with existing middleware
   - **Mitigation**: Test all existing auth flows after adding new routes, review middleware configuration

2. **Subscription Tier Enforcement**: Feature access checks may be inconsistent
   - **Mitigation**: Centralize checks in `hasFeatureAccess()` utility, comprehensive test coverage

## Deployment Risks
1. **Database Migration Failures**: Complex migrations may fail in production
   - **Mitigation**: Test migrations on staging with production-like data volume, implement rollback scripts

2. **Breaking Changes to Extension API**: API changes may break existing extensions
   - **Mitigation**: Version API endpoints (`/api/v1/prompts/`), maintain backwards compatibility for 1 major version

## Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive E2E testing before each release
- Feature flags for gradual rollout of risky features
- Database backups before migrations
- Monitoring dashboards for early detection of issues
- Incident response playbook for common failure modes
