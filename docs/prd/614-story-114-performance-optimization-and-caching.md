# 6.14 Story 1.14: Performance Optimization and Caching

**As a** user with a large prompt library,
**I want** fast load times and smooth interactions,
**so that** the app remains performant even with 1000+ prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Library view loads within 3 seconds for 1000+ prompts
2. Prompt builder opens within 500ms
3. Search results appear within 1 second
4. Auto-save completes within 200ms
5. Pagination or infinite scroll prevents loading all prompts at once
6. Database queries use indexes for efficient retrieval

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Caching strategy does not interfere with Next.js App Router caching
- **IV2**: Performance metrics tracked in production (Vercel Analytics)
- **IV3**: Database query performance monitored (Supabase dashboard)

## Technical Notes

- Implement pagination (50 prompts per page)
- Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use Next.js `unstable_cache` for expensive operations
- Implement lazy loading for prompt builder components
