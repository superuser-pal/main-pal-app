# 6.9 Story 1.9: Import/Export Functionality

**As a** user,
**I want** to export my prompts to JSON and import prompts from JSON or CSV files,
**so that** I can backup, share, and migrate my prompt library.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can export single prompt or entire library to JSON file
2. Export includes all prompt data (modules, options, variables, metadata)
3. Users can import prompts from JSON file with schema validation
4. Import detects conflicts (duplicate names) and offers resolution (skip, overwrite, rename)
5. Import validates data integrity and shows detailed error messages on failure
6. CSV import supports simple prompt format (name, description, content)

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Export file size is reasonable (compression if >1MB)
- **IV2**: Import respects subscription tier limits (prompt count)
- **IV3**: Import handles malformed files gracefully (no crashes)

## Technical Notes

- Use JSON schema validation (e.g., Zod)
- Implement streaming for large exports (avoid memory issues)
- Include export format version for future compatibility
