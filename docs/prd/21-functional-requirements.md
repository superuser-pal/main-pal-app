# 2.1 Functional Requirements

## FR1: Prompt CRUD Operations
Users shall be able to create, read, update, and delete prompts with name, description, folder assignment, and module composition.

## FR2: Modular Prompt Architecture
Prompts shall support a modular architecture where each prompt consists of multiple named modules (e.g., Context, Goal, Persona), and each module contains one or more options that can be selected during execution.

## FR3: Module Management
Users shall be able to add, rename, reorder, delete, and temporarily disable modules within a prompt, with changes reflected in real-time preview.

## FR4: Variable System
Users shall be able to define variables within prompt modules using `{variable_name}` syntax, with support for type definitions (text, number, date, select, multi-line), validation rules (required, min/max length, regex patterns), and default values.

## FR5: Folder Organization
Users shall organize prompts in a flat folder structure (no nesting), with ability to create, rename, delete folders, and move prompts between folders.

## FR6: Search and Discovery
Users shall search across prompt names, descriptions, module content, option content, and variable names with full-text search capabilities.

## FR7: Import/Export
Users shall export prompts to JSON format and import prompts from JSON or CSV files, with conflict resolution options (skip duplicates, overwrite existing) and validation for schema compatibility.

## FR8: API Key Management
Users shall securely store and manage API keys for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic), with ability to test validity, set nicknames, view last used dates, and revoke keys.

## FR9: Extension API
System shall provide authenticated API endpoints for browser extension to fetch user's prompt library, sync incremental updates, retrieve API keys securely, and track usage.

## FR10: Real-time Preview
Users shall see real-time preview of assembled prompt as they modify modules, options, variables, and module ordering.

## FR11: Subscription Tiers
System shall enforce subscription-based limits on prompt count, folder count, API calls per month, and storage using existing Stripe integration (Free: 100 prompts, Pro: 1000 prompts, Enterprise: unlimited).

## FR12: User Settings
Users shall manage profile (name, email, password), notification preferences, theme (light/dark), keyboard shortcuts, and API configurations through settings interface.

## FR13: Performance Targets
System shall support initial load <3 seconds, navigation <500ms, search results <1 second, auto-save <200ms, and handle libraries up to 10,000 prompts with pagination.

## FR14: Mobile Responsiveness
System shall provide responsive interfaces optimized for mobile (320px-768px), tablet (768px-1024px), and desktop (1024px+) with touch-friendly targets (44px minimum).

## FR15: Accessibility
System shall meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus indicators, and appropriate color contrast ratios.
