# Project Brief: PromptPal

## Executive Summary

**PromptPal** is a purpose-built prompt management system consisting of a web application for organizing structured, modular prompt libraries and a Chrome extension for instant execution with LLMs. It solves the friction of manual prompt storage and reuse that daily AI users face with generic tools like notes and spreadsheets, enabling faster experimentation, better organization, and seamless workflow integration.

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Store, organize, and execute AI prompts with modular components (persona, context, examples)
- Two-component architecture: comprehensive web management + lightweight browser execution
- Direct LLM execution and intelligent variable handling built specifically for prompt workflows

---

## Problem Statement

AI users struggle to store, organize, and reuse prompts efficiently. Current methods such as documents, notes, and spreadsheets are slow, manual, and error-prone, especially when experimenting with multiple models. Users need a lightweight but reliable system to structure prompts, manage modular components, and quickly run or share prompts without constant copy-pasting.

As AI adoption spreads, mid-level and casual users also face the same friction. They may not be "power users," but they still need simple, time-saving ways to keep prompts handy and reusable.

## Proposed Solution

The solution consists of two integrated components:

- **Web Application:** Central hub for creating, organizing, editing, and managing prompt libraries with full CRUD functionality.
- **Chrome Extension:** Lightweight execution layer that syncs with the web app, enabling quick access and execution of prompts directly in the browser while using AI tools.
